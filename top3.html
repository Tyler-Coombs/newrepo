            <aside><blockquote><p>At the base level, a burger is a piece of meet and a bun with something on it. It's simple but it seems to make a lot of people happy.</p>
            <cite>- Danny Meyer</cite></blockquote></aside>
            <p>Here are my choices for the top three places to grab a burger here in town:</p>
            <h3>1. Johnny and Mae's</h3>
            <p>You can not discuss burgers in St. John's without talking about Johnny and Mae's. This food truck's take on classic American Cheeseburgers is delicious.
            <div>
            <p>The flagship features two smashed beef patties, melty american cheese, bacon, shredded lettuce, and house "dirty sauce" (an enhanced version
            of big mac sauce).</p>
            <p>They also serve a southern fried chicken burger and usually have special burger that rotates to something new weekly.</p>
            <p>A link to Johnny and Mae's Facebook Page can be found below. From there you can see the menu, order food, or just browse through mouthwatering pictures 
            of what they are serving!<br></p>

        <h3>2. Bernard Stanley's Gastropub</h3>
            <p>Located on Duckworth, this restuarent has a great selection of very creative burgers that leaves little else to be desired.
            <div>
            <p>From a mushroom swiss burger to duck burger, this burger menu has something for everyone.</p>
            <p>A standout is the PB&J burger featuring strawberry jam, peanut butter,
            caramelized onions, brie cheese, jalapenos, lettuce, and bacon on a pretzel bun.</p>
            <p>Check out the extensive burger menu using the link to the restuarant website below.<br></p>

        <h3>3. Five Guys Burgers and Fries</h3>
            <p>Technically speaking, this American chain is not a local burger joint. 
            <div>
            <p>They have never operated in the province before but have a new location opening at the Avalon Mall in the coming weeks!</p>
            <p>Five Guys makes the cut because they make some of the best fast food burgers money can buy.</p> 
            <p>A favorite of burger lovers who get to travel out of the province, there is much excitement for the opening here in St. John's.</p>
            <p>In case you are unfamiliar with Five Guys, check out the short video below from Food Network to see what the excitement is about!</p>
